/**
 * The neutral scale every framework notation on the canvas shares: inks,
 * greys, borders and the card fill.
 *
 * **Wardley is the reference.** The values are the Wardley map's own (its
 * background `COLORS`, its node stroke and fill, its legend frame), so a
 * Wardley board is unchanged by this module existing; every other framework
 * (BPMN, C4, EDGY, the DDD notations, the generic templates) reads its neutrals
 * from here instead of restating a near-identical grey of its own. One scale,
 * one place to change it.
 *
 * **Hues stay per framework.** An event ring, a C4 container blue, a sticky
 * colour or an evolution red is the notation's meaning and lives in that
 * framework's `consts.ts`. So do the neutrals a notation borrows from an
 * official source (the C4 stencil's `#444444`, the Cynefin and Estuarine SVGs,
 * the EDGY facet picto) and the greys that carry a meaning (a future bounded
 * context, a Core Domain zone): those are content of the notation, not chrome.
 *
 * **No band tint.** The title or header strip of a board (BPMN participant
 * band, C4 board header, a generic template's column) is plain `cardFill`
 * white, set apart by its divider line (PO, 11/09/2026). The Wardley phase
 * bands are not chrome: a graded wash across four zones is the map's meaning,
 * so they stay Wardley's own.
 *
 * **Stored colours are never rewritten.** A creation default is copied into
 * the element when it is placed, so changing a value here repaints only the
 * render-time chrome of existing boards (backgrounds, cards, frames) and the
 * elements created from now on. Any code that recognises an element by its
 * stored colour must keep accepting the value it was created with.
