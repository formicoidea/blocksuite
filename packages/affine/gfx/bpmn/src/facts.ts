/**
 * Where a BPMN artefact SITS — the facts, answerable without a `BlockStdScope`.
 *
 * The audit already computes exactly this (`collectAuditFacts`), and computes it
 * better: it attributes across every framework at once and reports the answer as
 * a serializable fact. What it will not do is answer a question — it runs only
 * for frames matched by a REGISTERED validation rule, and BPMN registers none
 * until the rules session lands. A host, a template check or a rule being
 * written today therefore has nowhere to ask "which lane is this task in", and
 * has been doing the arithmetic by hand at every call site.
 *
 * These two functions are that arithmetic, once. Pure by construction — models
 * and a `Bound` in, model data out; no DI, no std, no signal — so a rule can
 * call them, a test can call them with a stub, and the answer cannot depend on
 * which extensions happen to be registered.
 *
 * ## Two conventions, and the asymmetry between them is the point (PF2.4)
 *
 * {@link bpmnPoolOf} asks about MEMBERSHIP and answers with WHOLE containment in
 * the pool's element bound — the shared `containingFrame`, the same test the
 * validation engine and the audit use, so one artefact never gets two answers
 * about which participant it is on.
 *
 * {@link bpmnLaneOf} asks about POSITION inside a pool it is already in, and
 * keeps the CENTRE against ratios of the PLOT, first matching zone in
 * declaration order — the convention `plotRatios` and `zoneAt` use in the audit.
 * A lane is a band drawn across a pool, and a task taller than a band still has
 * to be in exactly one of them.
 *
 * So a task must be WHOLLY inside a pool, but may straddle two lanes. That is
 * deliberate: a board is a container, a band is a reading.

 * no lane, when the centre is outside its plot, or when the partition is
 * malformed enough that `backgroundInstanceZones` dropped the band it would have
 * been in.
 *
 * The lanes come from the declaration, never from `pool.lanes` read directly:
 * `backgroundInstanceZones` is what normalises the weights into rectangles,
 * drops the rows a user's typo made unusable and redistributes their space, and
 * a second reading of the raw prop would place a task in a band the pool does
 * not paint. The `BpmnLane` handed back is the model's own row, matched by id,
 * so a caller gets the thing it can rename or resize.
 *
 * The CENTRE, deliberately unlike {@link bpmnPoolOf}: a task must be wholly in a
 * pool, but may straddle two lanes and is then read in the one its centre is in.
 * See the module comment — a board is a container, a band is a reading.
 *
 * First match in declaration order, so a centre landing exactly ON a divider
 * belongs to the band ABOVE it. Arbitrary in isolation and deliberate together:
 * it is the tie `zoneAt` breaks, and the two must break it the same way.
