 * give, and which the 2026-09-09 template audit measured on this pack: the
 * palette restated by hand what a node is, and the copy drifted. The four
 * single-element templates had lost the `role` the toolbox has written since
 * the EDGY roles landed (so `edgy.overlapping-artefacts` saw nothing, the auto
 * legend legended nothing and the info panel would not open), People arrived
 * ungrouped from its name, and the label box was 16/24/+70 against the
 * toolbox's 18/26/+72. Those templates are DERIVED now
 * (`templateFromCommand`), and the compositions that cannot derive are built
 * on the helpers below — so there is nothing left to restate.
